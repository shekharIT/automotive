Micro project description:
The customer wants an application to present some data (e.g. Restaurant, charging station etc..) based on the location of the car. In order to increase the quality of the data presented to the user, some filtering algorithm is needed in order to process the raw location data. The algorithms will be developed by a neighbouring team. Unfortunately, different car models will require different algorithms. The data shall also be stored so that the user can look at historical data, using the application. The application do only need to store this data when it is running though. The application will be started by explicitly by the user.
